# The Oasis

Oasis, as its name suggests, is a virtual sanctuary in the barren desert of monotony that
quarantine has induced. A single player game, Oasis aims to bring live, anonymous
interactions to players in the form of artistic creativity and engaging chat messages that enable
a friendly and welcoming environment for anyone looking to temporarily escape the mundanity
of lazing around at home.
Inspiration:
Over the recent months, people have been languishing in quarantine and yearn for
human interaction. We thought it would be a good idea to emulate the joys of content sharing
and social networking in our own virtual simulation.
Features:
● Cloud-based image storage that randomizes the paintings in the game
● Cloud-based message storage, enabling anonymous message sharing from anyone
around the world
● Relaxing ambient sounds paired with beautiful visuals
● Virtual drawing program that empowers players’ visual creativity
● Realtime shadows and reflections powered by the Unity High Definition Render Pipeline
Controls:
● WASD to move forward, backwards, left, and right (respectively)
● Space to jump
● M to post a message
● E next to a canvas to begin painting
○ Click to select colors
How it was built:
We used Unity’s built in 3D game construction API to edit and design the graphics and
implement game logic. Autodesk Maya was used for the creation of some models.
Available on Windows, Mac, Linux
